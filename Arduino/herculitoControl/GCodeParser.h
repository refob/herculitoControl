/// <summary>
/// The GCodeParser library is a lightweight G-Code parser for the Arduino using only
/// a single character buffer to first collect a line of code (also called a 'block') 
/// from a serial or file input and then parse that line into a code block and comments.
/// 
/// The parser was originally designed for use with code for the SphereBot, an EggBot clone.
/// 
/// Limitations
/// Currently the parser is not sophisticated enough to deal with parameters, Boolean
/// operators, expressions, binary operators, functions and repeated items. However, 
/// this should not be an obstacle when building 2D/3D plotters, CNC, and projects with 
/// an Arduino controller.
///
